# Uncle Ray's Quarantine Workouts

An iOS mobile workout application for Vancouver-based ultimate frisbee club teams, [Mola Mola](https://www.facebook.com/molamolaultimate/) and [Fable](https://www.facebook.com/fableultimate). Built with [React-Native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started) and [React-Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/). This app also uses [React Countdown Component](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-countdown-component).

All workouts are the intellectual property of Raymond Young, who is silent and deadly on the field, but kind and gentle in all other aspects of life.

This developer does not own the copyright to any of the GIFs in this application. They're taken from 7 Daily Workouts (which doesn't seem to exist anymore) and other corners of the internet where we all live. Please don't sue me. I don't have any money.
